cl_cpp_wrapper
==============

It is an opencl wrapper to allow running the same code on GPU &amp; CPU (for debugging) with minimum defines. 
It should be cross platform, but I have never tested it on Windows platform.

To use it, add CPU_OPENCL definition to the project and include cl_cpp_wrapper.h to you *.cl.cpp files.
